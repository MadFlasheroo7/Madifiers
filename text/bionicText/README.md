# Bionic Text
Bionic Text or Bionic Reading means creating “artificial fixation points” within a text by bolding
the first part of each word for our eyes to jump between, “guiding the eyes” across the page and
letting the brain complete the rest of the word on its own rather than having to stop and see the
entirety of every word on a page. This Bionic text is heavily inspired by [Bionic Reading](https://bionic-reading.com/)

# Sample
```kotlin
BionicText(
    text = "...",
    textAlign = ...,
    modifier = ...,
    fixationStyle = SpanStyle(),
    nonFixationStyle = SpanStyle()
    ...
)
```
