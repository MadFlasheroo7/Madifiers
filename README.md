# How & Why "Madifiers"?
When i first tried and learned jetpack compose and on **June 5th, 2021** and was learning about "modifiers",
my brain went "more like madifiers" so since then i wanted to build a library for compose and name it 
"Madifiers" and when i saw [Super Extension](https://github.com/AbhishekDoshi26/super_extensions) for flutter 
by Abhishek Doshi and [VelocityX](https://velocityx.dev/) by pawan kumar. So, I got an idea of why 
not make a library with bunch of modifier, extensions, and composables for jetpack compose. 
And that's how **Madifiers** came into into life.
