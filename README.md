# What is *Madifiers*?

Madifiers is bunch of pre-made composable, modifiers, extension functions etc...
Basically Anything and everything to make jetpack compose development easy and straight forward

# Features
- [Bionic Text](#bionic-text)

## Bionic Text
Bionic Text or Bionic Reading means creating “artificial fixation points” within a text by bolding 
the first part of each word for our eyes to jump between, “guiding the eyes” across the page and 
letting the brain complete the rest of the word on its own rather than having to stop and see the
entirety of every word on a page. This Bionic text is heavily inspired by [Bionic Reading](https://bionic-reading.com/)

# How & Why "Madifiers"?
When i first tried and learned jetpack compose and on **June 5th, 2021** and was learning about "modifiers",
my brain went "more like madifiers" so since then i wanted to build a library for compose and name it 
"Madifiers" and when i saw [Super Extension](https://github.com/AbhishekDoshi26/super_extensions) for flutter 
by Abhishek Doshi, I got an idea of why not make a library with bunch of modifier, extensions, and composables.
And that's how **Madifiers** came into into life.
